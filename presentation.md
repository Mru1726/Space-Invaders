## üß† Breadth-wise Understanding

### File & Module Structure

The project follows a modular file structure, organizing game components into separate scripts for better maintainability and clarity:

- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the game. Initializes everything.
- `player.cpp`: Manages the player spaceship class.
- `enemy.cpp`: Handles alien logic and movement.
- `bullet.cpp`: Bullet mechanics for player and enemy fire.
- `game.cpp`: Manages game loop, collision detection, score updates.
- `texturemanager.cpp` : Loads and renders textures.
- `assets `: Contains image files (PNG/JPG).
- `include/SDL2 `:SDL2 headers (external).

### Game Flow Overview

**1. Initialization (`main.cpp` & `game.cpp`)**
- Initializes SDL subsystems (`SDL_Init`, `IMG_Init`, `TTF_Init`).
- Creates an SDL Window and Renderer (`SDL_CreateWindow`, `SDL_CreateRenderer`).
- Loads textures using `IMG_LoadTexture()` through a custom `TextureManager` class.
- Initializes game entities: `Player`, multiple `Enemy` instances, and an empty bullet pool.

**2. Main Game Loop**
- The loop continues while `isRunning == true`.
- Each iteration performs the following in sequence:

a. Event Handling
- Captures keyboard input using SDL_PollEvent for real-time controls.
- Spacebar triggers a bullet spawn from the player‚Äôs position.

b. State Updates
- Player updates movement based on input flags.
- All bullets move upwards each frame.
- Enemies move downwards and may respawn if destroyed or offscreen.
- Game difficulty may scale based on score or enemy count.

c. Collision Detection
- Bullet-to-enemy intersection checked using `SDL_HasIntersection()`
- Ensures enemies are removed or respawned, bullets are deleted.

d. Rendering
- Clears the screen using SDL_RenderClear().
- Renders player, enemies, and bullets using SDL_RenderCopy().
- Displays score or game-over messages using SDL_ttf.

e. Frame Rate Control
 Uses SDL_Delay() to lock frame rate (typically ~16ms delay for 60 FPS).

3. Game Over Condition
- If an enemy reaches the player or bottom edge of the screen, the game ends.
- Game cleanup is triggered with SDL_DestroyRenderer, SDL_DestroyWindow, and SDL_Quit().


### Controls and Interaction

The game uses **keyboard input** captured via SDL‚Äôs event system. 
These controls are mapped in `main.cpp` and passed to the `Player` class for behavior.

| Key            | Action                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ‚Üê Left Arrow   | Move player spaceship left              |
| ‚Üí Right Arrow  | Move player spaceship right             |
| Spacebar       | Fire a bullet                           |
| Escape (ESC)   | Optional: Exit / pause (if implemented) |
| Window Close   | Quit game                               |


### Gameplay Elements

- **Player**: A spaceship that can move left and right and shoot upward
- **Enemies**: Aliens descending toward the player; random respawning
- **Bullets**: Fired by the player, travel upward and destroy enemies on contact
- **Game Over**: Occurs if an enemy collides with the player or reaches the bottom

## üîç Depth-Wise Analysis

This section explores the internal architecture and engineering choices behind the Space Invaders project. It focuses on the approaches taken during development, the data structures implemented, and key trade-offs considered by the original developer.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Approaches Taken

#### a. Object-Oriented Design (OOP)

The project is structured using **object-oriented principles**. Each core game entity is represented as a C++ class encapsulating its data and behavior:

- **`Player`**: Handles movement, screen boundaries, shooting bullets, and drawing itself.
- **`Enemy`**: Controls movement patterns, collision behavior, and respawning.
- **`Bullet`**: Manages bullet direction, velocity, rendering, and off-screen cleanup.

Benefits of OOP in this context:
- **Encapsulation**: Keeps functionality modular and isolated.
- **Reusability**: Enables use of similar logic across multiple objects.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features like enemies, power-ups, or effects.

---

#### b. Main Game Loop (Real-Time Frame Control)

The game uses a traditional **infinite loop pattern**, which cycles through all essential steps of game execution per frame. This loop is located in `main.cpp`.

The loop manages:
- **Input processing** using SDL‚Äôs event system.
- **State updates** for game entities like enemies, player, and bullets.
- **Collision detection** between bullets and enemies.
- **Rendering** all textures to the screen.
- **Frame delay** using `SDL_Delay()` to maintain consistent FPS (~60).

```cpp
while (isRunning) {
    handleInput();
    updateEntities();
    checkCollisions();
    render();
    SDL_Delay(16); // ~60 FPS
}
```

#### c. Event-Driven Input Handling

Input handling is implemented using SDL‚Äôs event-driven model. Keyboard inputs are captured by polling SDL‚Äôs event queue with SDL_PollEvent.
cpp 
```
SDL_Event event;
while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
    if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
        isRunning = false;
    }

    if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
        if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_LEFT) {
            player.moveLeft();
        }
        if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_RIGHT) {
            player.moveRight();
        }
        if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_SPACE) {
            player.shoot();
        }
    }
}
```
This approach allows for:
- Immediate reaction to user input
- Clean separation of input logic and entity behavior
- Easy mapping of keys to different actions

####  d. Manual Collision Detection 
Instead of relying on a third-party physics engine, the project uses manual collision detection with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) using SDL's built-in function:
cpp
```
if (SDL_HasIntersection(&bullet.rect, &enemy.rect)) {
    // Collision occurred
}
```
Benefits:
- Lightweight and performant for 2D gameplay
- Easy to understand and debug
- Perfectly suited for rectangular objects like sprites
This technique ensures fast and accurate collision checks with minimal performance cost.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structures Used

#### a. Classes (OOP Abstractions)
The core gameplay revolves around three main C++ classes, each encapsulating data and behavior:
- Player Class
  - Attributes:
    - `SDL_Rect rect`: Position and size of the spaceship
    - `SDL_Texture* texture`: Sprite used for rendering
    - `int speed`: Movement speed of the player
  - Methods:
    - `moveLeft()` and `moveRight()`: Updates position with boundary checks
    - `shoot()`: Spawns a bullet at player's location
    - `render(SDL_Renderer*)`: Draws player to screen

- Enemy Class
  - Attributes:
    - `SDL_Rect rect`: Position and size of the enemy
    - `SDL_Texture* texture`: Enemy sprite
    - `int speed`: Vertical descent rate
  - Methods:
    - `move()`: Moves the enemy downward
    - `respawn()`: Randomizes position and resets Y-axis
    - `render(SDL_Renderer*)`: Draws enemy to screen

- Bullet Class
  - Attributes:
    - `SDL_Rect rect`: Bullet position and size
    - `int velocity`: Speed at which it travels
    - `bool active`: Status of bullet (used/unused)
  - Methods:
    - `move()`: Updates Y-position each frame
    - `isOffScreen()`: Checks if bullet has exited screen
    - `render(SDL_Renderer*)`: Draws bullet if active
This abstraction allows:
- Cleaner code and single-responsibility logic per class
- Reusability (e.g., bullet logic could be reused for enemies)
- Easier future enhancements like adding power-ups or different enemies

#### b. Vectors (Collections of Game Entities)

The game uses **C++ STL containers** to manage dynamic lists of objects:

```cpp
std::vector<Enemy> enemies;
std::vector<Bullet> bullets;
```
- enemies: Stores all active enemy objects, updated and drawn every frame.
- bullets: Stores bullets fired by the player. Each bullet is updated and drawn independently.
- Inactive/expired bullets are removed after collision or going off-screen using erase-remove idiom or a boolean flag.

Benefits of std::vector:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Easy iteration with range-based for loops
- Fast access by index

#### c. SDL Rectangles for Hitboxes

-  Each entity (Player, Enemy, Bullet) is represented by an SDL_Rect for its bounding box.
- These rectangles are used for both positioning and collision detection.
  ```
  if (SDL_HasIntersection(&bullet.rect, &enemy.rect)) {
    // Collision detected
  }
  ```
This method performs Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) checks, which are:
- Extremely fast
- Well-suited for sprite-based 2D games
- Sufficient for simple rectangular hitboxes

#### d. Assets: Images and Textures

Images are loaded into SDL_Texture* using the SDL_image library:
```cpp
SDL_Texture* playerTexture = IMG_LoadTexture(renderer, "assets/player.png");
```
Textures are stored as pointers and passed to the rendering context using:
```cpp
SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, texture, NULL, &rect);
```
- Asset loading is typically done once at the start of the game via helper functions (e.g., TextureManager::Load()).
- Memory Management: Textures must be cleaned up at the end using SDL_DestroyTexture() to prevent memory leaks.
- While this version of the game doesn't include sound, it could be easily integrated using SDL_mixer.
